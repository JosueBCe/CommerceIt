    - hero with the categories carousel 
    - API call array of 4 images that will adapt to my backend 
    - CRUD in local storage:

        remove from cart, 
        add 1 more of the specified with "+" button, 
        sum the total of the number of items
        false pay display green the whole screen 
    - language by location 
    - 
    SOLVE ONCE, RUN EVERYWHERE THE SEARCH SECTION AND LIST
    - search and products
