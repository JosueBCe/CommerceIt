# Overview

This is the front-end code for a full-stack application and mobile app (Commerce It ). Includes user authentication and authorization by auth0 services. Responsive design is implemented following best practices and styling patterns. 

The purpose of this software is to consolidate my knowledge in complex React implementations, using react hooks (useReducer, useContext, useEffect, useMemo, useCallback) with database interactions by a secured api.
